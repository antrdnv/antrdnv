            <p class="measure"><strong>Anton Radionov, Freelance Designer.</strong> Working on the web and mobile applications, business and marketing websites. <span class="bg-white">Currently looking for the next project to take on.</span> Let's <a href="mailto:mail@aradionov.com">talk</a> about how could I help you. Here is what I find important:</p>
            <p class="measure"><strong>Scalability.</strong> You've probably heard that design is never done, therefore there is no reason for building the system that will serve all potential needs. Instead, building the system iteratively with a focus on functions and purpose. UI patterns, reusable components and leverage use of every asset.</p>
            <p class="measure"><strong>Aesthetics</strong> has a direct impact on usability and should serve to support and enhance the content and functionality. Reducing cognitive load. Setting up a visual hierarchy. Aesthetic design is natural, clean, and efficient, it makes the product pleasant to use.</p>
            <p class="measure"><strong>Content.</strong> All communication and interaction between product and user goes through the content. If copy, data, visual assets (icons, images, and graphics) struggle to make sense - nothing else will help user to understand the product.</p>
            <p class="measure"><strong>Strategy</strong> will balance all the above aspects and align them with the business goals. It should be clear what we are building, as well as how and why. Design is a tool that should be embraced by the business.</p>

            <p class="ph2 measure">By connecting artificial intelligence, knowledge, and business rules Hala team created an AI Assistant which automates IT and Business processes for enterprises. I was hired to lead design. Start building a design system and ensure consistency. Produce design quickly and iterate frequently. Together we built an MVP in 4 sprints in shape of HTML pages.</p>

              <p class="measure">Users will need to interact trough chat interface. And this is not their usual experience interacting with large databases. So, our strategy was to design a content first product asap, based on a design system that enables a clear communication between us and users. And start talking to them to impove the product.</p>

              <p class="measure">Early on, I started from design audit. Collected all ui bugs and flaws. Started to fix ones that are in align with marketing projects. A lot of work went into explorations on how design could be freshened up. And here are few concepts:</p>

              <p class="measure i o-60">Most of my work remained as concepts due technical limitations or else. Later I decided that I can handle WordPress to rebuild marketing website and build design system underneath. But no, I couldn't and later had to leave the team.</p>
