        <p><strong>Currently, I'm looking for full-time or part-time opportunities</strong> and advising <a href="https://hala.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noreferrer">Hala Digital</a>. In spare time working on <a href="https://antrdnv.github.io/showclock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noreferrer">Showclock</a> - a platform to discover what movies that are playing in nearest cinemas, and <a href="https://neatcreep.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" rel="noreferrer">Neat Creep</a> - a local community for creatives and artists.</p>

        <h5>Oct - Nov 2018</h5>
        <p><strong>Built an MVP and design system for <a href="https://hala.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hala Digital</a>.</strong> AI Assistant which automates IT and Business processes for enterprises that use SAP, Oracle or Microsoft Dynamics.</p>
        <p>I joined the team at an early stage when the number one priority was to ship sooner to prove the concept. Our approach was to build a scalable application with the system underneath that will allow us to iterate frequently without creating any development or design debt; content-oriented and seamless to use product.</p>
        <p class="collapsible link-action mb0"></p>
        <div class="content">
          <img src="./assets/hala-chat.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The AI-powered Chat interface is not a functional design that is expected to have using enterprise software. Our challenge was to prove that a chat interface could be functional as well. At every moment we are ready to support the user and guide him to task completion. For that, we deliberately choose what content we display at every step of the user flow.</p>
          <img src="./assets/hala-application.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Behind the chat we built an application to manage the system. The place where admins have a complete overview of usage, functionality to control AI, install new skills, browse integrations, etc.</p>
          <p>Screens were designed in a browser, feel free to take a look on some pages: <a href="./hala-digital/chat-initial.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">chat-initial.html</a>, <a href="./hala-digital/analytics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">analytics.html</a>, <a href="./hala-digital/integrations-catalogue.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">integrations-catalogue.html</a>, <a href="./hala-digital/usage-dashboard.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">usage-dashboard.html</a>, <a href="./hala-digital/404.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">404.html</a>, <a href="./hala-digital/email-template.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">email-template.html</a>.</p>

        <h5>Jan - Sep 2018</h5>
        <p><strong>Worked with marketing team at <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Semaphore CI</a>.</strong> Continuous integration and delivery platform powering the world’s best engineering teams.</p>
        <p>We started by conducting a design audit and later proceeded with website optimization. Together we increased a conversion rate of several pages, created landing pages, launched an e-book, and worked on the marketing website, blog, and community redesign.</p>

        <h5>Nov 2017</h5>
        <p><strong>Design at Flipboook.</strong> Creative and emotional gift idea, a flipbook that's created from a video. A project where I had complete freedom in creativity.</p>
        <p class="collapsible link-action mb0"></p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Conducting research and analyzing market showed us that there was nothing alike. Only a few outdated options that would hardly explain what flipbook is. So we had to compete in a gift market instead, where emotions are driving force.</p>
          <img src="./assets/flipboook-homepage.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Showcase the product, inspire visitors, establish credibility and answer frequently asked questions was a bottom line requirement for the page. The target audience was quite broad, it's anyone who has decided to look for a gift online. With that in mind, we designed a warm and straightforward experience that would eliminate all barriers from purchasing the product.</p>
          <img src="./assets/flipboook-checkout.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Checkout experience with focus on a video.</p>

        <h5>Feb 2016 - Aug 2017</h5>
        <p><strong>Led product design at <a href="https://airfy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Airfy</a>.</strong> Guest WiFi solution and digital marketing automation to increase visitor retention and grow businesses locally.</p>
        <p>Airfy aimed to become a one-stop solution for wi-fi and marketing. Leveraging technology a huge spectrum of possibilities opened to them. My task was to design them all with focus on aesthetics and make products consistent and pleasant to use.</p>
        <p class="collapsible link-action mb0"></p>
        <div class="content">
          <img src="./assets/airfy-homepage.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The target audience was local business owners/managers, small stores and retails chains. Airfy customers would get extensive analytics of by-passers and visitors, a number of marketing tools like visitor profiling and surveying, custom webpages, targeted advertisement, automated marketing, etc. and most important product - seamless wi-fi management system.</p>
          <p>To provide a better service to end-customers Airfy worked with local partners and distributors who'd have their own ecosystem within the application. Complex business could be inside, but the product had to be simplified as much as possible. In total, we had 26 sub-projects created and designed ±350 pages.</p>
          <img src="./assets/airfy-structure.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The application had 4 different user types: Customers, Partners, Distributors, Administrators. They all had a completely different set of features and a slightly customized interface.</p>

          <img src="./assets/airfy-app-godview.jpg" alt="">
          <img src="./assets/airfy-app-admin.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Creation of new account and software installation was custom for each user type.</p>

          <img src="./assets/airfy-register-public.jpg" alt="">
          <p>One of the key features for business owners was a survey that visitors had to complete in order to get access to free wi-fi.</p>
          <img src="./assets/airfy-survey.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Design at Airfy also required a creation of emails, advertisements and various graphics.</p>

        <h5>Jan 2016</h5>
        <p><strong>Created a concept for budgeting app Wallter.</strong> Partially it was just for the practice and partially I wanted to see why most of the apps solving exact same issue end up cluttered and impossible to use.</p>

        <h5>Mar 2019</h5>
        <p><strong>Reviewing values, looking for sustainability.</strong></p>
        <p>Thanks to the internet our opportunities are endless now. Individuals can choose whatever they want without considering any consequences. Proceeding with the next thing quickly and looking only forward. Great for business, but not so good for people...</p>
        <p>Information is flooding and it's tough to filter what's important. Especially in design, where, in reality, there is no right way of doing things, work will never be completed, and evaluation is a biased process. No one will argue with the statement that design is important, designers did a great job to be heard. Unfortunately, it gets adopted as a tool to increase sales and product value, not to design products for good! How else we got to <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">85% of websites being unable to choose text color</a>?</p>
        <p>Sustainability becomes a more and more used term in regards to the internet. Primarily it leads to environmental and sociological issues. From a design perspective, it unifies usability, accessibility, privacy, ethics, etc. under one roof to serve a greater good. Basically, everything that's raising the bottom line and increases product lifetime. If we'd strip out product to the minimum elements, how it'd look? That would be text, color, and space. Actually, that's enough for users, they don't need more, all they want is to complete the job (obviously I'm not working in the entertainment market) and leave. The rest is purely business desires which should be balanced out.</p>
        <p>To address at least some of the issues I'll keep focusing on and exploring what actually matters. Review every decision I make and strive for the ultimate use of available resources. Good design is invisible design, right?</p>
        <p>P.S. This is the beginning of me writing journal and exploring various topics.</p>
